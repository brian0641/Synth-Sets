## Overview

The **signal_generators** generate trading signals for the **signal_server**. The **signal_server** sinks the signals to generate Ethereum transactions to implement the trades.

See the file /Synth-Sets/signal_server/trade_signal_format.md for a description of the format of the trade signals.

### Current Generators

#### TokenSets_Generator
Monitors the TokenSets contracts to determine when a tokenset is in a "rebalance" phase. When found, a trading signal is emitted.

#### Manual Generator

Allows signals to be manually generated by reading in a file. Mostly for testing.
